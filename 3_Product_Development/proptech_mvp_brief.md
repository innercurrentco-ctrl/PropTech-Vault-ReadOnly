**PropTech MVP Project Brief & GTM Blueprint**

---

## 1. Lean Project Brief (for Dev Hiring)

### Objective
Build a mobile-first MVP for a PropTech platform that simplifies real estate discovery, agent interactions, and verification processes, aiming to replace fragmented systems (Zillow, Realtor.com) with a streamlined, Uber-like experience.

### Target Users
- Property Seekers (unverified)
- Verified Property Sellers (paying)
- Real Estate Agents (basic + verified tiers)
- Admin/Operations Team (for verification)

### Core MVP Features
- **User & Agent Registration:**
  - Basic account (free)
  - Verified account (with document upload & admin approval)
- **Document Verification Workflow:**
  - Government-issued ID, utility bill or property deed
  - Admin approval process
- **Listings Browsing/Search (minimal filter)**
- **Contact/Inquiry System** (basic contact form or internal messaging placeholder)
- **Priority Placement for Verified Users/Agents**

### Technical Stack (Suggested)
- **Frontend:** React Native or Flutter
- **Backend:** Firebase / Supabase (starter) or Node.js + PostgreSQL
- **Admin Dashboard:** Low-code (Retool or custom React admin panel)
- **Verification Add-On (Optional):** Stripe Identity / Persona (if budget allows)

## 2. Clean Investment Summary (for Early Backers)

### PropTech MVP: Investment Summary

**Problem:**
Real estate platforms are cluttered and untrustworthy. Scams, fake listings, and spam calls reduce user trust. Agents and property owners struggle to differentiate themselves.

**Solution:**
A modern mobile platform offering user-verified listings, verified agent badges, and priority placements. Think "Uber for real estate" where identity and trust drive value.

**Why Now?**
- Housing market digitization is accelerating
- Identity verification is cheap and scalable
- PropTech VC funding rebounding post-2024

**Revenue Streams:**
- Subscription: Verified user/agent tiers
- Ads: Platform-placed native ads
- Featured Listings: Paid boosts

**Ask:**
- $15K–$50K Seed/Angel capital to cover:
  - Dev sprint (8–10 weeks)
  - Design + frontend/backend dev
  - QA, pilot onboarding
  - Go-to-market (pre-launch campaign + targeted agent onboarding)

## 4. MVP vs Full Build Vision (Summary for Knowledge Systems)

| Feature | MVP | Full Build |
|--------|------|------------|
| User Onboarding | Basic + Verification | Geo-fenced, social login, CRM import |
| Listing Search | Keyword + Filters | AI-matching, 3D tours |
| Verification | Manual via admin | Auto with Stripe/Persona + KYC integrations |
| Agent Tools | Profile + Badge | CRM, analytics, chat, scheduling |
| Monetization | Basic subscription | Marketplace + Ad Network + Lead resale |

## 5. Notes on Knowledge System (Obsidian vs Notion)

### Obsidian:
- Better for deep linking, local-first data, networked knowledge
- Great for pattern recognition, founder-mode notes
- Markdown native

### Notion:
- Better for structured tables, databases, team collaboration
- Less effective for visual graph-based analysis

**Recommended:** Use **Obsidian** for founder learning, strategic mapping, and MVP vs full build distinction tracking. Use **Notion** for team playbooks, hiring briefs, pitch decks.
