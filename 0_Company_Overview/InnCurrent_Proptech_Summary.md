### **Market Positioning**

**Primary Launch Market:** Canada (GTA) for early traction and government support
**Strategic Expansion Market:** Hong Kong + Singapore — ideal for cross-border real estate flows, fast-moving PropTech adoption, and innovation grants

**High-Growth Target Use Cases:**
- Solo property owners managing assets across borders
- Real estate brokerages with multi-region clients
- Landholders in Asia seeking North American entry points

### **Funding & Collaboration Pathways**

**InnCurrent (Parent Entity) will:**
- Apply for R&D and Innovation Grants
- Lead outreach to FedDev Ontario, HKTDC, InvestHK, IRAP

**PropTech MVP (Subdivision) will:**
- Anchor MVP development for early traction and testing
- Position for grants targeted at early-stage digital adoption
- Remain agile for investor readiness and collaborative feedback

### **Short-Term Action Plan (Q4 2025)**
- Complete initial YSpace and Step-Up program intakes (Mississauga)
- Submit grant eligibility checklists (FedDev and IRAP)
- Finalize MVP deck with integrated modular housing logic
- Align with Gary Mak as MVP contributor or advisor (based on energy, not obligation)
- Reach out to Laney or other marketing leads *if organic traction begins*

### **Key Considerations**
- Avoid overexposing the NewEarthGrid vision under PropTech; remain grounded in market-ready use cases
- InnCurrent is the public face for funding and structured innovation
- PropTech MVP is lean, agile, and built to test market-product fit in two continents
- Marketing should emphasize *relief from dark UX loops*, transparency, and agentless systems
